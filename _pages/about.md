I am a BSc student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran and an NLP researcher at the [Tehran Institute for Advanced Studies](https://teias.institute/), where I conduct research on Large Language Models under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/) and [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/). Previously, I was a member of the [Human and Robot Interaction Lab](https://taarlab.com/) at the University of Tehran, contributing to research at the intersection of deep learning and robotics.

At present, my primary research interest lies in understanding the cognitive and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models and developing benchmarks that provide deeper insight into these mechanisms. Ultimately, my goal is to help LLMs interact with humans in a more natural, effective, and socially aware way, and I am currently designing a benchmark focused on social intelligence in LLMs toward this objective.
